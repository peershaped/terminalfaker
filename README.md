# terminalfaker
Runs lines in a fake terminal. 

This is not production ready yet. I't my first github project so do not use it!!.

I am planning to do the following:
* make it so you can enter commands in an array.
* The array will be thrown in to the Terminal object
* The commands will be run

# Purpose
The purpose of this terminal faker is simple to fake a terminal
All the commands entered in the array will be written on the screen with a typewriter effect.
The commands wil be read and interpreted.
SO for example i will be using it to fake writing a application letter for a company.

everything i want to be written is animated on the screen.
For the end user it seems as if some one is typing stuff in a terminal window.
